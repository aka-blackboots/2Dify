### What is 2Dify?

When was the last time you did the Floorplans yourself?
Never, right? 

Imagine that you can create your own floorplans, how? 

Code - APIs

Tool - Editor

### Why Floorplans?

Well, floorplans are easy but you're right 3D is more realistic.
Since the start of the human evolution we are dealing with classification of things around us.

So, if somebody wants to create a BIM model using floorplans?
Possible with 2Dify, 2Dify uses a TriDify layer which translates the floor information to 3D using Clay

but what about other workflow?
with 2Dify as a start, we can aim to create layers on top of 2Dify to support multiple use cases

### Why I'm doing it?
I was rejected by a lot of AEC firms
